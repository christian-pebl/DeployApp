## Core Features:

- Map Display: Display a map using Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium blue (#4A8FE7), representing trustworthiness, clarity, and a connection to the earth/water.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F5FA), almost white, creating a clean and spacious feel.
- Accent color: A contrasting vivid orange (#FF7F50), used sparingly for interactive elements like buttons and markers to draw attention.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif with a modern look and a little warmth, for readability and a friendly interface.
- Use clear, minimalist icons from an open-source library like Font Awesome or Material Design Icons for map controls and pointer symbols.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout, placing map controls (zoom, pan) in a non-intrusive manner.
- Incorporate subtle animations for map transitions and marker placements.
